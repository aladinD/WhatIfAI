<div class="textblock"><p>To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has more or less affected the whole world, <b>both socially and economically</b>. Thus, the <b>driving motivation</b> behind AMI and our project is to investigate its <b>respective impact</b> on various domains such as online traffic and economic performance. To this, we have decided for the following ML model strategy. <br  />
</p>
<p>First, data shall be collected that reflects <b>both pre- and post-corona</b> outbreak statistics in several <b>everyday scenarios</b> such as streaming activity, etc. The underlying data sets are then <b>split up</b> accordingly into two different time frames: pre and post corona-start.</p>
<p>The former data set is used to train an ML model which is able to sufficiently <b>characterize and predict</b> the model outcome for the <b>respective domain of interest</b> (internet traffic, social media, porn consumption, etc.) for a scenario where the <b>corona pandemic did not occur</b>. By doing this, we can very clearly address the <b>impact of corona</b> through the respective <b>error</b> between the second post corona-start data set and the predicted model output. This interpretable error metric can then be effectively <b>visualized</b> in the final web-interface.</p>
<p>Based on this model, its outcome and the respective error metric, a <b>future possible task</b> - that we will not further investigate - could be to <b>fully capture the pandemic dynamic</b> in a second subsequent model architecture. To this, the later data set can be used to train a model that allows for a <b>prediction of the actual outcome for the current corona pandemic</b>. Assuming that the model has been sufficiently trained, it is in theory also able to predict a - more or less realistic - outcome for <b>e.g. worse case numbers, higher infection rates etc.</b> The variation in this **"corona harshness degree"** could be implemented into the web-interface alongside above first model output. Furthermore, it allows the user to <b>interact with the model</b> by adjusting above dynamic parameters such as the case numbers. However, it is to be noted that this approach - while being very interesting - becomes an <b>increasingly speculative estimation</b> for a variation of the dynamic parameters and especially so w.r.t. <b>long term interpretations</b>. <br  />
</p>
<p>In summary, <b>two model approaches</b> are proposed where the first predicts a future <b>without corona</b> and the second one <b>with it</b>. In order to be able to precisely <b>highlight the impact of the pandemic</b> on the selected domains of our everyday lives, we decide to <b>realize the first model</b> in this project whose predicted output can then be compared to the accumulated real-world pandemic data in the form of an <b>error metric</b>. An example of how a <b>potential model output</b> would compare against the real data is depicted in below figure for the streaming domain which has seen a <b>surge during the pandemic</b> and especially after the lockdown.</p>
