#  Adaptation of the Original Research Question
[[_TOC_]]

# Problem Statement
As discussed below, most of the collected candidate data sets **do not qualify** as valid ML model entries. This is mainly due to the fact that either the **amount** - and thus the **representative time window** - is insufficient or because of the observation that some of the respective data sets show **significant discontinuities** which cannot be explained by the model. The latter ones are particularly prevalent in the SocialCrawler YouTube reference data set which can be seen in below figure for the respective **subscriber count**.

Considering these major drawbacks, the remaining data is **scarce** and thus **not informative enough** for a detailed investigation of above initial problem statement. In particular, the remaining **usable** data sets are:
a) Internet Exchange Points
b) COVID-19 data
c) Google Trends
d) Gaming 
e) Twitch Streaming

# Reformulating the Project Proposal
Consequently, we have decided to expand the horizon of the project by adding the **economic dimension** to the problem at hand. By doing this, we can not only interpret the impact of the pandemic on the remaining data sets on online activity but also investigate the **concurrent economic developments** of the past few months. In particular, this also allows to **draw conclusions** between both of these domains by analyzing companies that are somewhat related to online traffic - such as Google, Netflix, Zoom, etc -  and their respective **economic performance** during the pandemic. Consequently, another interpretation can be made between **"the new tech"** and **"the old"** by comparing the economic impact of the pandemic to aforementioned **technology giants** and some more traditional areas such as the **oil and steel industry**.  Furthermore, there are **many accessible APIs** for stock markets which are of a **high data resolution** and more importantly go **way farther back in time** than the YouTube reference data set. 

We thus believe that above adaptation of the initial project proposal is only **reasonable** considering the **insufficiency of the obtained data sets**. Furthermore, it does not significantly change the main project idea and/or motivation but surely **expands its perspective** allowing for an even **more coherent** interpretation and conclusion.
